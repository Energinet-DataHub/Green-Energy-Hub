# Contributing to Green Energy Hub

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to the project!
We appreciate your interest in growing the Green Energy Hub, and want to help your contribution be successful.
There are a few guidelines to contributing that we'd like to lay out.
Respecting them pays respect forward to the time the developers maintaining and managing this project have put in.
In return, they will respect your contribution by addressing issues and discussing and helping finalize pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute, including updating documentation, fixing issues, reporting bugs, requesting features, or even adding functionality.

## Ground Rules

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->

1. Please review our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.
1. Like many open source projects, we ask that you sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/green-energy-hub) before we can accept your contribution.
1. If you find a vulnerability in our code, please follow the guidelines in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
1. Use the [provided templates](/.github) for [bugs](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Bug_Report.md), [pull requests](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), [feature requests](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Feature_Request.md), and [support questions](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Support_Question.md).
  Filling out all the relevant information will give your contribution a higher chance of getting looked at and resolved faster!
1. New public behaviors should have accompanying tests.
  // TODO: Provide an example of this.

## Your First Contribution

Contributing to open source can be intimidating, but you can do it!
There are a few guides online that can help you get started:
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on Github](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) is very good, as is [firsttimersonly.com](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

For Green Energy Hub specifically, we have a few labels that are worth checking out.
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
Issues that should only be a couple lines of code, a test or two, or a little documentation work are under the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/microsoft/green-energy-hub/labels/good%20first%20issue) tag.
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
The [help-wanted](https://github.com/microsoft/green-energy-hub/labels/help%20wanted) tag is attached to pull requests that need more attention.

## Code Review Process

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
Pull requests will be reviewed to ensure they meet the requirements laid out in the [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
Pull requests require 2 approvals before being merged into `main`.

Ideally, these approvals should come from different groups/teams to make sure that knowledge is being evenly distributed.
After feedback, if there is no response in 2 weeks, we may close the pull request.

## Community

We have a public [Teams channel](). // TODO: Link

We will hold public office hours once a month, with times to be decided (maybe two sets, one for Europe, one for US).
Meeting recordings should be linked in the repository at `docs/meetings/{year}/{month}/{day}`.
