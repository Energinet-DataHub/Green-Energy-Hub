### *The First Contribution*

Contributing to open source can be intimidating, but you can do it!

There are many ways to contribute, including updating documentation, fixing issues, reporting bugs, requesting features, or even adding functionality.

The Green Energy hub consists of many repo's as we want to develop a micro-service structure in a domain driven environment. This means that when contributing, you must try to align the topic and to which domain repo it belongs.

When in doubt on the relation of the topic or issue - Go to the Green Energy Hub repo, or *#green-energy-hub-general* on Slack
