# **Dictionary**

This dictionary will cover the general use of attribute naming in documentation - This will NOT contain all technical naming throughout the project - but a general definition of objects.

The terms listed here are all terms relating to the topics of defining metering.

## **The Concept of Metering**

| Term   | Definition    |
|----------|-------------|
| **A** |   |
| Accounting Point |  A domain under balance responsibility where Energy Supplier change can take place and for which commercial business processes are defined. **Additional information:** This is a type of Metering Point. |
| Asset Type | The technology used on a specific metering point  |
| **B** |   |
| Business Reason Code | Indicates the business context, e.g. E23 = 'Periodic metering' used with time series |
| **C** |   |
| Created Date Time | A date and time property used in all messages exchanged with Green Energy Hub. It indicates when a particular message was created |
| Child Metering Point | a sub category of metering points that are all in relation to an accounting point  |
| **D** |   |
| Disconnection Type |  How the metering point can be disconnected |
| **E** |   |
| End Date Time | A date and time indicating the end of a time series period |
| Estimated Annual Volume | The predicted annual volume of consumed energy for an accounting point  |
| Exchange Point |  A domain for establishing energy exchange between two Metering Grid Areas. **Additional information:** This is a type of Metering Point.|
| **F** |   |
| **G** |   |
| **H** |   |
| **I** |   |
| Industry Classification | Indicates the industry context, e.g. E23 = Electricity |
| In Area | Indicates which grid an exchange point transports energy into   |
| **J** |   |
| **K** |   |
| **L** |   |
| **M** |   |
| Meter ID | ID for a physical device containing one or more registers.|
| Meter Reading Periodicity| The frequency for which a metered data will be submitted |
| Meter Type |  |
| Metering Grid Area |  A Metering Grid Area is a physical area where consumption, production and exchange can be measured. It is delimited by the placement of meters for continuous measurement for input to, and withdrawal from the area. **Additional information:** It can be used to establish volumes that cannot be measured such as network losses. |
| Metering Point | An entity where energy products are measured or computed.|
| Metering Point ID | A unique metering point identifier |
| Metering Point Type | Indicates the type of a metering point, e.g. Exchange |
| MP Description | An option that can be used to describe how a physical meter can be located, e.g. basement |
| Multiplier |  Meter conversion |
| **N** |   |
| **O** |   |
| Observation Time | A calculated value that indicates a date and time for a position in a time series |
| Out Area |  Indicates which grid an exchange point transports energy out of |
| **P** |   |
| Parent Metering Point | A term used when a Metering Point, or Accounting Point becomes part of a Metering Point Parent-Child hierachy, where the Parent acts as the top-level Metering Point. |
| Point | One point equals one measurement within in time series. If a metering point is hourly read, a time series for a single day contains 24 points (Except for days switching between daylight saving time and standard time) |
| Position | Indicates the position of a measurement within a time series' period |
| Product | An energy product identification, e.g. active energy |
| **Q** |   |
| Quantity | Quantity of a specific type of energy |
| Quality | Indicates the quality of a specific quantity in a time series, e.g. estimated, measured, etc. |
| **R** |   |
| Rated Capacity | The maximum amount of power contracted for a metering point |
| Rated Current |  The maximum amount of current contracted for a metering point |
| Register | A physical or logical counter measuring energy products |
| Registration Date Time | A time series property indicating the point in time the time series measurements were read of the metering point |
| Resolution | A resolution defines the precision a time series period is divided into. Expressed using ISO 8601, where e.g. 'PT1H' equals an hourly resolution |
| **S** |   |
| Settlement Method | A metering point's settlement method, e.g. flex settled |
| Start Date Time | A date and time indicating the starting point of a time series period |
| **T** |   |
| Time series ID | A unique time series identifier provided by the sender |
| Time series period | The time interval covered (by the time series) |
| **U** |   |
| Unit | The measure unit, e.g. kWh (kilowatt-hour) |
| **W** |   |
| **X** |   |
| **Y** |   |
| **Z** |   |
