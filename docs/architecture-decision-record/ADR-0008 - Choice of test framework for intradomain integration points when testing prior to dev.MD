# How to test integration points within domains prior to deploying to DEV (U) environment

Technical Story: [description | ticket/issue URL] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

How can we leverage integration testing, so that it

* Increases our software confidence
* Supports an efficient development process
* Enables a fast and reliable feedback loop
* Guards the DEV environment from becoming unstable and thereby increases DEV availability
* Enables us to ensure connectivity and data correctness

To ensure that integrations with external dependencies (storage, communication bus etc.) are set up correctly and the application logic works as expected prior to deploying to DEV (U), we need a framework that enables us to run integration tests both on localhost and in the continuous integration pipelines. Result is to cover even more risk elements prior to deployment, which would enhance the complete lead time for functionality delivery.

## Decision Drivers

* We need an integration test solution that fits a microservice architecture as well as the practices of DevOps
* The solution must solve the problem with cloud components that cannot be emulated, specifically for local testing efforts
* We emphasize failing fast, having quick and reliable feedback loops and DEV environment stability and availability
* We want a solution that does not require a full domain setup deployed as a cloud environment and are not affected by infrastructure
* The solution must be easy to set up and tear down as part of PR gate
* The solution must be able to run seamlessly both on localhost and in a CI pipeline.

Following use cases were identified, that needs to be covered by this test framework:

* ### Integration to Event Hub

Verifying event is generated in event hub and that it contains expected data.

* ### Integration to a ServiceBus

Publishing an event from an application, and being able to verify that the event data contains the expected data.

* ### Databricks integration to a DeltaLake

Publishing an event from an application, and being able to verify that the event data contains the expected data.

***Please note, that this use case are still pending decision***

* ### Integration to an Sql database

Read/Write access for reading and storing a record from an application.
The database must be seeded with appropiate test data prior to running the application code.

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Running integration tests in a Test Container
* Option 2: Running integration tests in a PR environment
* Option 3: Using a test framework like Squadron, that enables to test in a container setup with the ability to connect to services in Azure.

* â€¦ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

For use cases regarding components like eventhub, service bus and Sql database we have implemented a Sqaudron based solution, where it is possible both local-hosted and in CI pipeline to ensure application-to-service  connections.

***Regarding the use case for DeltaLake - it has not yet been finalized on which solution is most valuable, and therefore the decision to cover this is still pending.***

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Besides testing component connections locally Squadron allows verification that components are connecting correctly to storage instances by creating a containerized setup where both application layer and service is connected in an infrastructure setup (excluding Terraform - further outline on this under negative consequences).

* The solution is implemented to run both locally and in CI setup.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

One risk area that has been mentioned for this strategy for testing prior to dev is that the solution does not cover testing of compliance and quality of the solution deployed with correct Terraform modules. This risk is also be present in a test container setup - but could be mitigated by a PR environment solution. We are already using a PR environment solution to ensure that the Terraform based Infrastructure as Code works as expected. The PR environment was also tested as a solution for intra-domain integration testing. This is can be done, but depending on the testing discipline a very expensive solution, and is therefore not the approach we have choosed.

You can find an overview on the testing activities across environments [HERE](https://github.com/Energinet-DataHub/dh3-documentation/blob/fdbcae1774d7bd41d32108516ebfadfae74e15e8/DOCS/images/test-strategy-visual%202021-0830.png)

***Mitigation of DEV (U) instabilities due to this risk, should be handled - please create an issue if risk occurs***
