When the Washington Redskins announced Friday that the organization is conducting a “thorough review” of the team’s name, the statement did not say who would be doing the review, how long the study would take or what the franchise hoped to accomplish.

The only hints could be found in an accompanying statement from team owner Daniel Snyder, who said the process would consider the “proud tradition and history of the franchise,” adding the team would get input from “our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National Football League and the local community.” People familiar with this review and similar ones conducted by the Redskins in the past say it is a more informal process, primarily led by Snyder, with the owner speaking to key advisers and league officials.
