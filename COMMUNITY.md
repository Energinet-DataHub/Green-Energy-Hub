# The Green Energy Hub Community

## *Where to find the latest news*

The Domain Overview in [README](README.md) will tell you where to read about the current work being done in each domain.

A solution Roadmap for each domain indicates which activities are currently within scope, and maintainers on each repo are responsible to update the community on the roadmap outline within a specific domain.

## *Getting in touch with the Commit Team*

The Green Energy Hub is still in the progress of defining how we want to ensure the work being done across the community.

Be assured that if you want to participate or ask any questions, the community will be focusing on keeping in touch and being transparent - so please don't hesitate to reach out on any of our channels, [Github](https://github.com/Energinet-DataHub/green-energy-hub), [Email](mailto:greenenergyhub@energinet.dk) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/greenenergyhub/shared_invite/zt-ik120p69-h8sysERkqRGS0Fj6adKqBw)

For now all contributing issues and pull requests are screened by identified maintainers within a specific repo, and maintainers will ensure to handle and respond to any inquiries submitted.

*When in doubt submit an issue to [Green Energy Hub](https://github.com/Energinet-DataHub/green-energy-hub)*
